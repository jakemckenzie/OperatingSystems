1.4 Keeping in mind the various definitions of operating system, consider
whether the operating system should include applications such as web
browsers and mail programs. Argue both that it should and that it
should not, and support your answers.\\\\

Answer: \\

My argument for an operating system with an email client and web browser built in 
would be that larger more involved environments benefit in some function 
way by including such features. Windows and Ubuntu, for example, are served by 
including such applications because they are desktop environments.  \\\\

My argument for an operating system without an email client 
and web browser built in would be for smaller environments 
typically not used on the desktop. These would include smaller 
embedded devices such as printers and LeapFrog computers for kids. 
These embedded devices are smaller and have more focused devices 
for specific tasks.\\\\
1.6 Which of the following instructions should be privileged?\\\\
\begin{enumerate}[a)]
    \item Set value of timer. ANSWER: \textbf{Privileged} From page 26 and 27. 
    Before turning over control to the user, the operating system ensures 
    that the timer is set to interrupt. If the timer interrupts, control 
    transfers automatically to the operating system, which may treat the 
    interrupt as a fatal error or may give the program more time. 
    Clearly, instructions that modify the content of the timer are 
    privileged.
    \item Read the clock. ANSWER: \textbf{Unprivileged} Not mentioned in the
    text but it should be obvious that every process should be able to read 
    the clock because otherwise every process would be a mess and no process 
    could get anything done. 
    \item Clear memory. ANSWER: \textbf{Privileged} Not mentioned in the 
    text but it should be obvious that memory is sacred and requires 
    privileged access. If a process does not have access to a piece of 
    memory then the OS needs to deny access to that process.
    \item Issue a trap instruction. \textbf{Unprivileged} I can't find 
    this in the text but it would seem obvious to me from lecture that 
    all processes need some way to terminate themselves.
    \item Turn off interrupts. \textbf{Privieleged} From 
    page 52. Various instructions are privileged and can be executed only 
    in kernel mode. Examples include the instruction to switch to kernel 
    mode, I/O control, timer management, and interrupt management.
    \item Modify entries in device-status table. \textbf{Privileged} From 
    page 52. Various instructions are privileged and can be executed only 
    in kernel mode. Examples include the instruction to switch to kernel 
    mode, I/O control, timer management, and interrupt management.
    \item Switch from user to kernel mode. \textbf{Privileged} From page 52.
    Various instructions are privileged and can be executed only in kernel
    mode. Examples include the instruction to switch to kernel mode, I/O
    control, timer management, and interrupt management. 
    \item Access I/O device. \textbf{Privileged} From page 52. Various 
    instructions are privileged and can be executed only in kernel mode. 
    Examples include the instruction to switch to kernel mode, I/O
    control, timer management, and interrupt management.
\end{enumerate}
1.8 Some CPUs provide for more than two modes of operation. What are two
possible uses of these multiple modes?\\\\
Supervisor mode and privileged mode, both of which allow for more varied 
types of access through a varying hierarchy protection of domains.\\\\
1.12 In a multiprogramming and time-sharing environment, several users
share the system simultaneously. This situation can result in various
security problems.\\\\
\begin{enumerate}[a)]
    \item What are two such problems? Identity theft and theft of service 
    often security problems that arise in multiprogramming and time-sharing 
    engironments. 
    \item Can we ensure the same degree of security in a time-shared 
    machine as in a dedicated machine? Explain your answer. We cannot 
    ensure the same degree of security in a time-shared environment than 
    dedicated enviornment because cannot lock down that system in the same
    way. By it's nature a time-shared machine is more complicated than 
    a dedicated machine. More complexity means a higher propensity for 
    the possibility of bugs and less likely that resources will be allocated 
    fairly. This is not a given that this will be the case but it is the obvious 
    answer to me.
