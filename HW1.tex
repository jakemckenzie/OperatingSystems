1.4 Keeping in mind the various definitions of operating system, consider
whether the operating system should include applications such as web
browsers and mail programs. Argue both that it should and that it
should not, and support your answers.\\\\

Answer: \\

My argument for an operating system with an email client and web browser built in 
would be that larger more involved environments benefit in some function 
way by including such features. Windows and Ubuntu, for example, are served by 
including such applications because they are desktop environments.  \\\\

My argument for an operating system without an email client 
and web browser built in would be for smaller environments 
typically not used on the desktop. These would include smaller 
embedded devices such as printers and LeapFrog computers for kids. 
These embedded devices are smaller and have more focused devices 
for specific tasks.\\\\
